Had an idea for a small maze then I went to build a full blown BFS algorithm to solve it
idea was originally a small 3X4X4, but i went directly for an 8X8X8

graphing a 3 representation of the BFS solution thereafter, didnt like it, so I 
programmed an interactive model using plotly scatterplot3D

So much better... was fun.

Idea for real life applications... 
  ROBOTIC or "drone" flight, directional changes, programatical controls, object detection
  next to integrate flight
    object detection
    and return flight to origin
